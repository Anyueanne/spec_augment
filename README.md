# SpecAugment.py: A Pytorch implementation of GoogleBrain's SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition

## COMING SOON

SpecAugment is a SOTA-achieving data augmentation approach on speech recognition. The paper's authors did not publish code that I could find and their implementation was in TensorFlow.

## To use:
1. run `install.sh` (I recommend to use a unique `conda` env for the project)
2.
