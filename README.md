# SpecAugment.py
## A Pytorch implementation of GoogleBrain's SpecAugment: A Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition

SpecAugment is a SOTA-achieving data augmentation approach on speech recognition. The paper's authors did not publish code that I could find and their implementation was in TensorFlow.

## To use:
1. run `install.sh` (I recommend to use a unique `conda` env for the project)
2. Check out SparseImageWarp.ipynb (a Jupyter notebook) for the functions.

### Augmentations
1. Time Warp (Coming Soon)
This augmentation relies on a lot of functionality not yet in Pytorch, so I have to write it from scratch. I am working on it.

2. Time Mask (DONE!)

3. Frequency Mask (DONE!)
